Opportunistic networks (OppNets) make use of human mobility and local forwarding to distribute data. Information can be stored and passed, taking advantage of the device mobility, or forwarded over a wireless link when an appropriate contact is met. Such networks fall into the intersection of mobile ad-hoc networks and delay-tolerant networks. However, the difference is that OppNets send messages opportunistically, and there is no end-to-end path available in these networks. OppNets are based on the "carry and forward" technique, and messages are saved in the intermediate nodes' buffer until delivered to the destination.
